# SwiftKey-NLP-Capstone-Project
SwiftKey Text Data and Natural Language Processing NLP Capstone Project

- Build a predictive algorithm based on NLP (Natural Language Processing).

- Build a Shiny App that integrate the predictive text model and algorithm.The app will accept a text input and will predict the next word.

- Swiftkey technology is used for this project emulating the way the prediction work on SwiftKey's smart keyboards on smartphones.
